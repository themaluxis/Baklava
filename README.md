## 🍯 Overview

**Baklava** is both a **server-side powerhouse** and a **frontend overhaul** for Jellyfin.  
It introduces smart caching, remote stream integration, complete user-to-admin request handling,

Baklava ensures your Jellyfin experience stays fast, reliable, and visually polished.

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🧠 Server-Side Intelligence

#### 🔁 Adaptive Caching & Stream Handling
Baklava enhances Jellyfin’s caching layer, allowing it to **adapt dynamically to remote streams** (ideal for Gelato users).  
It reduces redundant probing and improves playback stability across all platforms — even TV clients.

#### 🧩 Smart Probing for Tracks
Automatically fetches **audio and subtitle tracks** from remote streams for every platform, including Android TV and Fire TV.  
Baklava ensures your playback options are complete before the media even starts loading.

> This makes it a perfect companion for the **Gelato** plugin — unlocking full hybrid-source playback.

### 📬 Complete Requests System

#### 🙋 User-to-Admin Requests (Jellyseerr-like)
Baklava introduces a **fully native request system** within Jellyfin — bringing the power of Jellyseerr directly into your dashboard.  
Users can submit requests for unavailable content, track status, and get notified upon approval or import.

- Requests are stored **per user** with status tracking  
- Admins can **approve or deny** requests via a built-in interface  
- Works seamlessly with **manual imports** and **Gelato discovery**

#### ⚙️ Configurable Behavior
From the **plugin configuration page**, you can:
- Disable **Global Search Toggle** for TV clients (enforcing safe, local searches)
- Toggle **Auto Import** to allow or restrict direct imports (ideal for managing user permissions)
- Enable/disable the **Requests Feature** entirely for automation scenarios

### 🧭 Manual Import System

Baklava introduces a **Manual Import Modal**, acting as a **middle-layer between Gelato and Jellyfin**.  
Instead of automatically importing everything Gelato finds, Baklava opens a detailed preview modal:

- Displays **cast, metadata, reviews, and artwork**  
- Lets users confirm before import  
- Prevents redundant or accidental imports  
- Streamlines admin control

### 🎨 Interface Enhancements

Baklava replaces Jellyfin’s old dropdowns with modern, flexible UI components.

#### 🧱 Smart Selectors
Each version, audio, and subtitle field now uses a **responsive carousel or dropdown**, designed for clarity and speed.  
Long filenames are truncated elegantly, with hover or click revealing full details.

#### 🌈 Stremio-Inspired Look
The new design blends Jellyfin’s structure with Stremio-like cues —  
clear visual hierarchy, smooth transitions, and adaptive layouts that look great across web and TV clients.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Requirements
| Plugin | Purpose | Link |
|--------|----------|------|
| **Gelato** | External source search integration | [lostb1t/Gelato](https://github.com/lostb1t/Gelato) |
| **File Transformation** | Stream transformation and compatibility | [IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) |

**Dashboard → Plugins → Baklava**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Baklava intercepts Jellyfin search, playback, and request actions,  
and intelligently routes them through its own optimized logic layer.

- **SearchActionFilter:** Handles routing between local and global sources  
- **StreamInterceptor:** Manages stream probing and caching  
- **RequestManager:** Tracks user/admin request workflows  
- **UI Injector:** Replaces Jellyfin’s version/audio/subtitle selection system with the new visual interface

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| UI not loading correctly | Clear browser cache and restart Jellyfin |
| Requests not saving | Check file permissions under Jellyfin data directory |
| Global search toggle missing | Ensure Gelato is installed and enabled |
| Missing subtitles/audio | Verify probing is enabled in plugin settings |
